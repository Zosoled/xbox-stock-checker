# xbox-stock-checker
continuously checks a storefront for stock of the xbox series x, and plays a loud horrid sound if it's in

### how to use
1. go to desired xbox product page (sample links below)
    - [why? same-origin policy i.e. browser security](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Same-origin_policy)
1. hit f12 to open dev tools
1. switch to "console" tab in dev tools
1. copy code from xbox-stock-checker.js
1. paste into console and press enter

code runs in background while browser tab remains open

this should work for ps5 pages too, but i was shopping for xbox, so that's why it's named as such ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
